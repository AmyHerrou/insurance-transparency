# TRANSPARENCY OF INSURANCE COVERAGE 
#### Goal:
 Is to give a clear understanding of insurance coverage across providers based on patientâ€™s denied and approved pharmacy claims. 
 #### Questions to solve are:
ðŸŒ± Are there any major differences across insurance providers regarding the frequency of their approved and denied cases?
</br>
ðŸŒ± Would the insuranceâ€™s financial status affect their decision?
</br>
ðŸŒ± Coverage differences across plan types?
</br>
ðŸŒ± Location: frequency of denied/ approved across states 
</br>
ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s the actual quality of each insurance plan or provider? Any outstanding factors?

 
This project could be a benefit to insurer (new or old) to have a better understanding of what their insurance actually cover. Therefore, this could be a good resource for them to make further decisions (to switch, keep, or change ) to their insurance plan.
